# Exercises

In the following exercises, write the SQL as requested to discover the answer.

## Task 1

How many records are in the country table?

```{python}
# How many records are in the world_bank_data.wdi_country table?
# (skills: select, aggregate)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select
  count(*) as "Row Count"
from
  world_bank_data.wdi_country
""")

```

## Task 2

Explore the first 5 records in the country table.

```{python}
## write out the first 10 records and look at the columns
## Do you see any blanks or missing data?
## (skills: select, limit)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select
  *
from 
  world_bank_data.wdi_country
limit 5
""")

```


## Task 3

List all non-countries.

```{python}
## task 3
## Which records are NOT for countries, that is they're for regions or groups of countries.
## How can you tell?
## Once you figure it out, write a query to list all the non-countries
## (skills: select, where)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select
  *
from
  world_bank_data.wdi_country
where
  country_type != 'Country'
   or country_code is null
   or country_region = 'Aggregates'
""")
```

## Task 4

Create your own copy of WDI_Country containing just countries.

```{python}
## task 4
## The WDI table clearly contains information for countries and non-countries
## using CREATE TABLE ... SELECT from WHERE syntax.
## Finally, below write a query to return the number
## of records in the new table.
## (skills: select, aggregate)

# drop table
execute_ddl(cnx,"""
drop table if exists wdi_country;
""")
```

```{python}

select count(*) as "Country Count"
from wdi_country
""")
```

## Task 5

## (skills: select, aggregate)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select count(*) as "Countries in 2020"
from wdi_country
where last_updated_year = 2020
""")

```

## Task 6

What are all unique values of region in the wdi_country table?

```{python}
## Let's investigate the country_region field.
## What is the domain of the country_region field? That is,
## what are the unique values found there?
## (there are several possible ways to code this in SQL)
## (skills: select, aggregate, order by)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select distinct country_region
from wdi_country
order by country_region
""")

```

## Task 7

```{python}
## List the country full names and regions for all countries in north america
## (skills: select, where, order by)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select
  country_full_name,
  country_region

""")

```

## Task 10

```{python}
## There are two abbreviation fields in the data country_abbr and country_wb_abbr.
## List the country code, short name, abbr, wb_abbr and region for all the countries
## where the abbr and wb_abbr are different.
## (skills: select, where, order by)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""

  and country_wb_abbr is not null
  and country_abbr != country_wb_abbr
order by
  country_short_name
""")

```

## Task 11

```{python}
## Now, let's investigate the "income category" field.
## List the income categories and the number of countries in each
## income category in descending order of most countries to least.
## (skills: select, aggregate, group by, order by)

```

## Task 12

```{python}
## Mystery task.  Looking at the table from Task 11 (anything odd?) write the
## next obvious query based on the results in the table.
## At a minimum, your query should put country short name in the first column.
## you will be scored on the number of records returned and the value(s) 
## in the first column.

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select
  country_short_name,
  country_full_name,
  country_region,
  country_income_group

  wdi_country
where
  country_income_group is null
order by
  country_short_name
""")


```

## Task 13

```{python}
## OK, this HAS to be an error. Let's make a assumption that the country 
## in question, because they are oil-rich, are "high income".  
## Write an update comment to correct the issue.
## NOTE - if you get this wrong, all subsequent tables will be wrong!

execute_ddl(cnx,"""
update wdi_country
set country_income_group = 'High income'
where country_short_name = 'Kuwait'
""")

```
```{python}
## Now, display the country again to verify the change stuck!

select
  country_short_name,
  country_income_group

  wdi_country
where
  country_short_name = 'Kuwait'
""")

```

## Task 14

```{python}
## Write a single query that show the number of countries in each 
## "Region"-"Income Group" pair.  The table should have 3 columns:
## region, income group, and no.of.countries.
## (skills: select, aggregate, group by, order by)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select

""")


```

## Task 15

```{python}
## Examine the result from task 14. It would be really cool to
## present the results of this table in a 2-D form, with 
## columns for each income category (high, upper middle, lower middle, low, other)
## regions down the side, and the pair-wise count inside each cell.
## Using CASE statements, DO IT!  BE SURE to include the countries without
## an income category.

## HINT - your query should return 6 columns: the region name, one
## column for each of the income categories (e.g., High, Upper middle, etc.)
## and a column for the row totals.
## (skills: select, aggregate, group by, nested query)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""

  country_region,
  count(case when country_income_group = 'High income' then 1 end) as high_income,

  count(case when country_income_group is null then 1 end) as unknown_income,
  count(*) as total

  wdi_country
group by
  country_region
order by
  country_region
""")

```

## Task 16

```{python}
## Wow! what a cool table!  It is very interesting to see where the money
## sits around the world.  Using the general approach from Task 14 above
## and write a query to return the single region with the most lower-income
## countries.

## Your query should return 3 columns, the number of 
## low-income countries, the region name and the income group

## PUT THE NUMBER FIRST! (use: count, region name, income group)
## (skills: select, aggregate, group by, nested query, order by, limit)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select
  count(*) as num_low_income,

order by
  num_low_income desc
limit 1
""")

```

## Task 17

```{python}
## Are you getting the hand of this? Good! We need to take a look at all
## the countries in the same region and with the same income category as
## the Marshall Islands.
## For each country that matches, print their country code, short name,
## region and income category, by order of their short name.  As a hint,
## the country code for the Marshall Islands is MHL.
## (skills: select, where, subquery)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""

  )
order by
  country_short_name
""")


```

## Task 18

```{python}
## OK - let's raise the heat in the kitchen! Review the output from task 14.
## You'll see that some of the regions do not contain all of the income
## levels.  For example, the Europe & Central Asia region does not have
## any low income countries.
##
## CHALLENGE - using a SINGLE SQL statement, write a table that contains every
## combination of region and income category (including the missing '') values!
##
## THEN add a WHERE clause to only show the values that were missing from
## the original pairings!
##
## HINT - there should be AT MOST [# of regions]x[# of income cats] = 28
## rows in your final table, and there are 22 rows returned in the query
## in Task 14.  (FYI - I get 6 rows in my final table.)
## (skills: select, where, subqueries, joins)

## Task 19

```{python}
## Hot enough, yet?  Let's go for ghost-pepper HOT!  Now let's build some
## percentage tables.  For example, across the entire sample, what
## is the percentage of total countries in each income category?
##
## As a first step, build off the result from task 14 and create a table with
## six columns (region, income cat, country count, sum of countries in region,
## sum of countries by income and total sum countries).
##
## THEN, add a 7th column calculating the percent of total for each,
## region-income pair.
##
## actually calculating percentages and print out a table will be a

# Reflection

1. Reflect on the SQL skills you used throughout these exercises. Which skills do you feel most confident in, and which do you think need more practice? How has this assignment helped you build or reinforce specific SQL competencies?

   This assignment reinforced many foundational SQL skills and helped strengthen more advanced ones. I feel most confident using `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, and `ORDER BY` for basic filtering and summarizing tasks. I also improved at using `CASE` statements and subqueries to pivot data or pull specific comparisons. The tasks involving CTEs, especially for Tasks 18–20, pushed my understanding of multi-step transformations and handling missing data. I would like more practice with pivoting and calculating percentages across multi-level summaries, but overall, this assignment gave me strong confidence in working with real-world datasets.

2. Problem-Solving Approach: Describe your approach to tackling the more complex tasks (like Tasks 18, 23, and 24). How did you break down these problems, and what steps did you take when you encountered challenges? How would you approach a similar problem differently in the future?

For complex problems like Tasks 18 and 19, I broke them down into smaller queries. First, I identified what each part of the result needed (e.g., all combinations of regions and income groups, or calculating totals per group). I wrote individual CTEs to generate each component, verified them, and only then combined them. When I got stuck, I looked at patterns from earlier tasks and reused logic from Tasks 14–16 to guide the structure. If I tackled these again, I’d sketch out the result structure first and write test queries more systematically.


3. Learning Takeaways: Consider the overall learning experience from this assignment. What were the biggest takeaways about working with SQL for data analysis and transformation? How do you think these skills will apply in real-world scenarios or future coursework?

The biggest takeaway from this assignment was understanding how SQL can be used not just for querying, but for **data analysis** and **transformation**. Working with real development indicators showed how important clean joins, groupings, and conditional logic are when turning raw data into insights. These skills are directly applicable in the real world — whether in business analytics, public policy, or research — and they’ve given me a better grasp of how analysts work with international datasets like WDI.
